<h1>What this session is about</h1>

<ul>
<li>You are now students of computer science and so you hopefully have some
    experience with programming, data structures and algorithms.</li>

<ul>
    <li>As you come from various backgrounds and have studied various things at
        various ways at various places, we do not know much about your knowledge
        and skills. This is why we do this check-up, to learn something about you.</li>

    <li>As you probably know, some previous skills and knowledge are required for
        the studies you are just starting. You may or may not have all of these
        skills at the moment, this does not matter much. What matters is that you
        now find out which skills or knowledge you are missing, so that you have
        enough time at the beginning of your studies to learn the stuff you are
        missing, before you encounter some classes where this knowledge will be
        required.</li>
</ul>


<li>Our main focus now is the "dreaded" hard obligatory course 
<a
    href="https://is.cuni.cz/studium/eng/predmety/index.php?do=predmet&amp;kod=NTIN066">NTIN066
    Data Structures I</a>, which you will need to pass in the summer term.
<ul>
    <li>
    For this course, you need to have sufficient prior
    knowledge of various data structures and algorithms, such as binary search trees,
    hash tables, sorting, tree traversal or matrix operations. We'll quickly
    look at some of those today so that you see what you need to know and we
    see whether you know it and we all see whether you still need to learn it.
    </li>
    <li>
    You also need to
    be able to perform low-level programming, using only the most basic structures
    and constructs. In fact, it is highly recommended to do the homework
    assignments for that course in the C programming language (not even C++ but pure C).
    This is why we will do all programming today in C. However, do not worry
    if you do not have experience with C or C++ (as long as you have
    experience with programming in some other procedural language).
    The course materials contain examples to help you jump into C with no
    trouble, and as we will be only using the most basic structures and
    constructs, there is not much you need to learn. So just follow the
    examples, run the codes, and you will see that the basics of C are
    actually quite simple.
    </li>
</ul>
</li>

<li>So keep calm, try to do the exercises one by one, and feel free to ask for
help if you need it.
<ul>
    <li>
    If you are taking the course physically, just raise your
    hand and ask.
    </li>
    <li>
    If you are taking the course remotely, or if the course has already ended and
    you are doing the exercises at home, send us an email; our email addresses are listed at the
    bottom of this page.
    </li>
    <li>
    You can also search the internet. However, keep in mind that this course is
    mainly for you to find out what you know and what you need to learn.
    Therefore, if you decide to "cheat" by looking up complete solutions to the
    tasks, you are not cheating us (we do not care) but yourself. If you get
    completely lost, looking up a solution and going through it to understand it
    is still better than nothing, but please please first try hard to solve the
    task yourself, take your time, experiment, try out various things, try to
    understand... this way you will learn much more.
    </li>
</ul>
</li>

<li>Once you've done some or all of the exercises, please send us your
    solutions per email, so that we can look at it and give you some further
    feedback.</li>

<li>At the end of the course, we will try to give you personalized
    recommendations on which knowledge and skills you seem to be missing, and
    we will suggest to you some additional courses to take.
    <ul>
        <li>
        Take this only as
        a recommendation, you are free to gain the missing skills and knowledge in
        any other way, such as taking online courses, studying books, learning
        from online materials, etc.
        </li>
        <li>
        It is just that simply taking courses that are
        already offered by the faculty may be the easiest way.
        Note that you are free to take any courses offered by the faculty or,
        in fact, the whole Charles Univesity; so feel free to subscribe to any
        course of interest in the <a
            href="https://is.cuni.cz/studium/eng/login.php">Student
            Information System</a>.        
        </li>
        <li>
        See the <a href="courses.html">Recommended Courses</a> subpage for a
        list of courses which we generally recommend. Of course, it may be a
        good idea to take some of these courses even if we did not explicitly
        recommend them to you if you do not feel sufficiently confident in
        the subject. In principle, you are expected to know most of what is
        taught in these courses.

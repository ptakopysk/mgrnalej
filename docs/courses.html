        Programming 1</a> - introductory programming course, does not expect
    any knowledge of programming; taught in Python.<br>
    <em>The Programming I course is very tightly coupled with the Introduction to
        Algorithms course. It is expected that you take both of the courses
        together; it is very hard or impossible to take them separately.</em>

        Introduction to Algorithms</a> - introductory course of data
    structures, algorithms and programming techniques. You need to know the
    stuff taught in this course to be able to pass the obligatory <i>Data
    Structures I course</i> -- either you know it already, or please go to
this course (this is for your own good).<br>

        Programming in C++</a> - introductory course of programming in C++,
    expects basic knowledge of programming but no knowledge of C/C++</li>

        The C Programming Language</a> - introductory course of
    programming in C, expects basic knowledge of programming but no knowledge
    of C/C++; <b>taught in summer semester</b></li>

        href="https://is.cuni.cz/studium/eng/predmety/index.php?do=predmet&amp;kod=NSWI015">NSWI015
        Unix/Linux Programming in C</a> - a more advanced course of
    programming in C for Unix</li>
<li><a
        href="https://is.cuni.cz/studium/eng/predmety/index.php?do=predmet&amp;kod=NSWI120">NSWI120
        Principles of Computers</a> - a course delving deep into the
    architectures of computers, so that you really understand how the
    processor works, how the programs access RAM, etc; expects no prior
    knowledge of programming or computers</li>

<li><a href="https://is.cuni.cz/studium/eng/predmety/index.php?do=predmet&kod=NTIN060">NTIN060
Algorithms and Data Structures 1</a> - crucial algorithms and data structures:
assymptotic complexity (big O notation), trees (BST, AVL, RBT), hashing,
sorting, graphs (BFS, DFS), MST, dynamic programming. The <i>Data
Structures course</i> will expect that you know especially the basic trees and hashing, and assymptotic complexity. <b>Taught in summer semester.</b></li>

<!--<li><a href="https://is.cuni.cz/studium/eng/predmety/index.php?do=predmet&kod=NTIN061">NTIN061
Algorithms and Data Structures II</a> - continuation of ADS I, covering some more advanced problems and algorithms. Not really necessary </li>-->

        href="https://is.cuni.cz/studium/eng/predmety/index.php?do=predmet&amp;kod=NTIN066">NTIN066
    Data Structures I</a> - a hard obligatory course that you will
need to pass in the summer semester; it has assignments that should be
completed in C/C++, so you must be prepared for that by the start of the
summer semtester!<br>
